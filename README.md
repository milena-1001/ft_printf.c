# ft_printf

This project consists of a custom implementation of the standard C `printf` function.

---

## Overview

`ft_printf` reproduces the behavior of the classic `printf`, supporting format specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%x`, and more. The goal was to deepen my understanding of:

- Variadic functions in C  
- Handling different data types dynamically  
- String formatting and output  
- Managing edge cases and error handling  

---

## How to Use

Compile with:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o ft_printf ft_printf.c
Then run your program linking with ft_printf or test it directly.

## What I Learned

This project helped me improve:

Understanding of variadic arguments (va_list)

Manual parsing of format strings

Writing modular, reusable C code

Careful memory and error management
